# Performance-Evaluation-of-Digital-Modulation-Schemes-Over-Diverse-Wireless-Channel-Models
This project evaluates the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of digital modulation techniques such as PSK, QPSK, OQPSK, 16PSK, QAM, DPSK, and OFDM under multiple wireless channel models including AWGN, Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, and Shadowed fading.

The system simulates transmission, noise effects, fading characteristics, demodulation, and signal reconstruction. 
A BER heatmap, CSV summary and signal reconstruction plots are generated for analysis
